## About

- **Problem:** Commuting to college can be frustrating, especially at UMN Twin Cities. Finding affordable and convenient parking is difficult and time-consuming.
- **Audience:** Students, faculty, and visitors traveling to the UMN Twin Cities campus.
- **Goal:** Provide personalized parking recommendations based on user preferences and input data.

## Features

- **Search bar:** Users can search for parking spots by name. Currently returns up to five similar results.
- **Filters:** Narrow down parking options for a more personalized experience.
- **Suggested Parking Spots:** Recommends parking locations based on user data and filters. *(Under development)*
- **Submit Parking Suggestions:** Users can submit new parking locations to expand the database.

## Version 1.01 — 01/27/2020

This version represents the second iteration of the project.  
- Backend: Flask with SQL database for parking and user data management.  
- Authentication: Google Sign-In via OAuth 2.0 for security and ease of use.  

**Goal:** Once completed and deployed, Park&Go aims to significantly reduce the time and effort required to find affordable parking near UMN campus.

## Technologies

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL  
- **Frameworks / Libraries:**  
  - Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, SQLAlchemy, PyMySQL  
  - Flask-Login, Authlib, Requests, python-dotenv  
- **APIs:** Google OAuth 2.0  

## Problems / Future Development

**Future Development:**  
- Learn React and migrate front-end for better scalability and maintainability.  
- Fix JavaScript to correctly display loaded parking data.  
- Build improved search logic.  
- Develop the recommendation algorithm.  

**Current Problems:**  
- Codebase may be difficult to scale for larger projects.  
- CSS is repetitive and inefficient, leading to slow development and maintenance challenges.  
- HTML structure is suboptimal, making enhancements harder.

## Lessons Learned

- Using a modern front-end framework like **React** could reduce development time and improve maintainability.  
- Inefficient CSS can make seemingly simple tasks (like creating a sidebar) take hours.  
- Planning code structure early is essential for scalable web applications.
